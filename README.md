## About Me

Originally from Bangalore, India, I am currently a second year undergraduate studying Engineering Systems Design at the Singapore University of Technology and Design with a focus on Business Analytics. I have a keen interest in Blockchain Technology, especially in the intersection of Game Theory and Blockchain. I also am really keen on learning more about the potential use cases of Blocklchain technology in the industry. In my free time I love to play the drums and listen to rock music! My other hobbies include struggling to cook a simple meal in the kitchen!

## How to Contact Me

I prefer being contacted on Whatsapp or Telegram for any urgent communication. However when possible I prefer to settle things over a Google meets or simple phone call so that it is easier to articulate and communicate the point accross more easily. I prefer to follow up every call with a summary of the key points discussed over a message on Telegram/Whatsapp for future reference. I may reply to emails a lot slower due to the fact that it takes longer and bit more effort to craft an email with the right format etc. 

## Preferred Working Style

* I prefer to have a set of clear cut goals and deliverables that need to be completed by the end of the day so that I can plan and organise my work a lot more systematically 
* In general, I like to have my work planned out (But not to the second) and would always work towards meeting the days target no matter however longer I would need to work and finish it becuase if I have some backlog from the previous days it really bothers me 
* Given the option, I sometimes might like to work on site rather than from home as that would give me a change in envorinment from the university hostel which I do need very much from time to time 
* I would generally follow up with my supervisors on a day to day basis giving a summary of what I have done for the day
* I generally do prefer the hustle lifestyle over a slow paced one since such an environment would always keep me on my toes and give me a sense of purpose and fullfilment 
* I would love to get to know my co-workers on a more personal note by going out with them for meals and really connecting with them better
* I also really appreciate being given the opportunity of being entrepreneurial while still being a part of a larger organisation

## What Motivates Me

Seeing my work being put to use and having impact within and outside the organization is what really drives me! Knowing that I am an indispensable resource to an organization is what gives what motivates me to keep at my work. I am really passionate about learning new things especially in the areas I am interested in exploring and I do enjoy a challenge every now and then!

## What Demotivates Me

Not being recognized for the effort that I put in and not being taken seriously during meetings and discussions are two things that really demotivate me. That being said if I have genuienly not performed a task up to the expectation I would highly appreciate any feedback on how it can be improved and I really value an honest opinion. 

## My Values (and what I value in others)

* Empathy is something that I really value in leaders and co-workers. Being understanding to one's situation and responding accordingly is in my opinion a true mark of a leader.
* As mentioned before, honest feedback and opinions is also something that I really value 

## My Blind Spots

* Social anxiety is one blind spot of mine. Sometimes in meeting I might not know what to say or how it is appropriate to react. In other situations the conversations that I sport might easily go dry because I might not know what to say next to keep the ball rolling.
* Another blind spot of mine is that sometimes I tend to overcommit and sign up for too many things. While I do try my absolute best to ensure that I keep up my end of the bargain sometimes when things get too much to handle I would need to compramise on the smaller things.


## Other

* I love coffee a lot especially a good cappuccino and a latte. 
* I love pets especially really cute puppies and kittens 
* I easily bond with anyone with a great taste in music xD

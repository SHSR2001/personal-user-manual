I have a keen interest in Blockchain Consensus, Incentive Design, Cryptoeconomics and Game Theory! I also am also interested in learning more about Cryptography and Distributed Systems. My long-term goal is to design a Blockchain protocol that can sufficiently address current problems in security, privacy and scalability.

Previously, I worked at Tribe Academy - a dedicated educational institute curated for aspiring developers looking to propel their career in deep-tech (With a focus in Blockchain), as a curriculumn associate. I also had the immense pleasure of delivering a Blockchain course in the international [FOSSASIA OPENTECH SUMMIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZHHr82qeiM&list=PLzZVLecTsGpLJimYhW1vsxb8IsnLDuYVO&index=38).  

I have also co-authored a [self paced course on Blockchain Technology](https://self-paced-course.opennodes.com/)!

# My Work at the Ethereum Foundation <a name="My">

As an RA for the Ethereum Foundation, I have the chance to collaborate with some of the leading minds in the industry and take part in regular research discussions with them where we dissect papers spanning across various topics in Blockchain ranging from cryptoeconomics, to cryptography and classical consensus. Ever since I have joined the Foundation, I have had the privilege of working on three exciting long term projects

### Beacon Digest 

- The aim of the project is to use data analytics tools to monitor the newly launched beacon chain metrics, study the dynamics in the system as they play out, and diagnose issues relating to proof-of-stake consensus. 
- As a part of this project, I have released several [research notebooks](https://shsr2001.github.io/beacondigest/) which were peer reviewed by prominent researchers in the field such as Vitalik Buterin.
-  A lot of pre-existing publications and papers were used to orient the analysis in each of these notebooks

### BeaconRL

- Another major project of mine was BeconRL which aims at building a reinforcement learning based framework for consensus level attack detection on the Ethereum blockchain. 
- As such, I have successfully built a pipeline that integrates the existing simulation environment used by researchers at the Ethereum Foundation and the commonly used OpenAI Gym RL framework. 
- We are currently in the process of running various experiments to train off the shelf RL models to detect previously known attacks on the blockchain

### EIP-1559

Finally, a major part of my work is also focused at analysing on-chain mempool data under various circumstances and studying the effects of a varying learning rate on Ethereum’s transaction fee market, post the famous London hard fork. 

I have co-authored a **research paper** on the topic and am in the process of drafting another

# Past Research Experience <a name="Past">

### Resource Allocation and the Blockchain Mining Economy

- I previously had the privilege to work as an Undergraduate Student Researcher at the Algorithmic Game Theory and Dynamical Systems research group to investigate the stability of different Blockchain ecosystems using formal mathematical and economical models.
- Some of my tasks included:
  - Observing the blockchain ecosystem and collect the necessary data to motivate our research.
  - Developing formal mathematical and economical models to describe the interactions that occur between the validators/miners in the ecosystem.
  - Running extensive simulations to trace the system experimentally beyond the analytically tractable scenarios.
  - Using ML/AI tools to understand large scale multi-agent systems


# Technical Projects <a name="Technical">

### Port Optimization using Splinter and Hyperledger Fabric

- I got the oppoortunity to work with the well-reputed multinational corporation Cargill in an industry practicum aimed at port optimization.
- I lead the technical team to develop a solution for streamlining supply chain information sharing using Distributed Technology. 
- We built a proof-of-concept using Hyperledger Fabric and Splinter - Cargill’s open source privacy-focused platform for communication and transactions between organisations in just 2 weeks!

**We got featured Showcased at the [Singapore Fintech Festival](https://bit.ly/3oIY6Um) alongside other digital consulting projects with IBM**

### ZilGAM

- I led a team of 5 to build a web platform for generative art and music tokenized by NFTs on the Zilliqa blockchain.
- We received a grant of SGD 10,500 from Zilliqa Research for the project
- It was a tremendous learning opportunity for me to get exposed to a number of cool and interesting aspects of leading a project from the idea conceptualization to the team recruitment, and the more technical smart contract development and web interface wireframe development.
